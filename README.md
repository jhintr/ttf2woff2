A webfont package for the [LXGW-WenKai](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai)-Light typeface.

It only deals with the light weight part, and I will keep extending characters that not included in the `unicode.json`.

Benefits a lot from the work of @chawyehsu https://github.com/chawyehsu/lxgw-wenkai-webfont
